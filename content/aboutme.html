    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am an aspiring game programmer, dreaming of working on some of my favorite game franchises. I’m currently in my senior year of high school at CTE in Essex and looking into tech schools on the east coast to start my career in the game industry. Over the course of my life, I have been very active in terms of sports and after school activities. My best friend and I started our school robotics club in 8th grade. That summer I achieved the rank of eagle scout and went to Philmont scout ranch in New Mexico for my troop’s 100-mile trek in the Rockies. For sports, I’ve played lots. I participated in Lacrosse, baseball, basketball, and soccer clubs during elementary and middle school. As well as the JV Nordic Ski team, JV soccer team, and JV Lacrosse team in high school. I hope to continue participating in sports teams during college as well as clubs that I may be interested in.
