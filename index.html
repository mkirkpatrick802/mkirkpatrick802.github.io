                    <p>
                        I am a passionate and driven individual currently studying how Game Programming patterns can be
                        applied
                        to Digital Twins to support agriculture and environmental conservation.
                        My profound love for adventure and traveling fuels my desire to explore the world and embrace
                        new
                        experiences.
                        When I’m not studying, you can find me outdoors, hiking through scenic trails, camping under the
                        stars,
                        and experimenting with cooking in nature’s kitchen.

                    <h2>What?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am currently studying Game Programming at Champlain College,
                        but my academic journey is just beginning as I plan to further my education with
                        a master's degree in Food Systems at UVM. My goal is to combine my technical expertise
                        with my passion for agriculture and environmental conservation.

                    <h2>When?</h2>
                    <p>
                        My journey into the realm of Game Programming began in 2019,
                        driven by a fascination with technology and interactive experiences.
                        In 2022, I took a significant step by starting work in the conservation industry,
                        where I aim to combine my technical skills with my passion for sustainability.

                    <h2>Where?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Originally hailing from rural Vermont,
                        I have always felt a deep connection to the outdoors.
                        Whether it’s hiking through lush forests, camping under starry skies, or scaling rugged cliffs,
                        my love
                        for
                        nature knows no bounds.
                        This connection to the environment guided my professional journey,
                        leading me to work with the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps (VYCC)
                        and the aquaculture company AquaBaan in Bangkok, Thailand.
                        My academic pursuits and personal adventures have taken me to various corners of the world,
                        enriching my perspective and fueling my ambition to support sustainable practices through
                        technology.

            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>
                Game Programming and Food Systems are two degrees that might seem unrelated,
                but I believe they form a perfect combination for my aspirations. Game Programming teaches me
                how to
                structure complex systems efficiently
                and manage input data in consistent ways that make real-world sense. Games are digital worlds
                with
                invented
                systems, and with Digital Twins,
                I aim to create similar digital representations of real-world systems.
                A strong understanding of Food Systems is essential for grasping the many layers that interact
                with the
                environment.
                By blending these disciplines, I aspire to leverage cutting-edge technology to
                foster sustainable practices and protect our planet for future generations. Moreover,
                I want to make Digital Twins accessible and fun to use, encouraging more people to engage with
                and
                benefit
                from these innovative tools.
